          <p>The Anne Frank Memorial Project is an Augmented Reality experience designed for the Anne Frank Memorial in Boise. It covers the history of discrimination and its connections to modern day hate-based ideologies, showing how the spiral of injustice can quickly go from language to discrimination to extermination, how its effects have repeated many times throughout history, and are still happening today.</p>
          <p>This was the first project I worked on as part of a professional development team. As one of the primary programmers on this project, I used the SwiftUI framework to implement the lesson plans we were provided, while assisting with the RealityKit AR sections of the app where they were needed.</p>

          <h2>ACHD Roundabout Project</h2>
          <h3>C#, Unity</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>This project is a Virtual Reality simulation of a roundabout, designed to teaching people how to properly use a roundabout in an immersive, low-stress environment. </p>
          <p>I was one of the programmers on the project's team, and I focused on creating an activity where the player is inside a car, and must control its speed along the road to safely make their way through the roundabout.</p>

          <hr>
          <p><i>Myrmidon</i> was my first true foray into game development in the Unity game engine. I wanted to tinker with the idea of a platformer where the player controlled two characters at once. This game has the player control the human character with the mouse, and their fire spirit companion with the keyboard.</p>
          <p> The game was narratively based on an old D&D character of mine, a druid who sheperded spirits of fire to places of power and freed those enslaved by humanity. Mechanically, the game inspired by <i>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</i>, a puzzle/adventure game where the player controlled two characters each with a different half of a controller; I took my game more in the direction of a platformer than <i>Brothers</i>, however.</p>
          <p>This project was completed individually, where every part of the project was made by me, aside from a required piece of starting code for the platforming.</p>

          <h3>C#, Unity</h3>

          <p><i>The Deck of Many Spells</i> is the second major game I made in Unity, as part of a group project to design a 2D game with Augmented reality elements. The game involves a physical deck of cards (not showcased in the above video) that determine the level the player will try to complete. Three cards are drawn and scanned: the first determines the level's objective, the second the type of enemy, and the third the spell the player has access to.</p>
          <p>As part of the group, my focus was on the player character's design and programming. I created the movement and animations for the player, including three unique spells. The fire spell was a projectile that could ricochet and pushes the player in the opposite direction, an ice spell that blocks projectiles and can smash enemies in melee, and a lightning spell that can teleport the player in a burst of deadly electricity.</p>
