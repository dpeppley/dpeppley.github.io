          <p>The Anne Frank Memorial Project is an Augmented Reality experience designed for the Anne Frank Memorial in Boise. It covers the history of discrimination and its connections to modern day hate-based ideologies, and is designed to fight against radicalization.</p>
          <p>I was one of the primary programmers on this project, and I was learning to use Swift and Xcode while working on this project, as it was my first time using the language and platform. Additionally, this was my first project as part of a professional development team, as compared to the group projects for my college courses I have done in the past.</p>

          <h2>ACHD Roundabout Project</h2>
          <h3>Unity</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>This project is a Virtual Reality simulation of a roundabout, designed to teaching people how to properly use a roundabout in an immersive, low-stress environment. </p>
          <p>I was one of the programmers on the project's team, focused primarily on building the in-car experience in the latter end of the game.</p>

          <hr>
          <p><i>Myrmidon</i> was my first true foray into game development in the Unity game engine. I intended for this
            game to feel like a sort of demo for a larger game, a story-driven adventure platformer of sorts.</p>
          <p>This project was completed individually, where every part of the project was made by me, aside from a required piece of starting code for the platforming.</p>

          <hr>
          <p>The Deck of Many Spells is the second major game I made in Unity, with augmented reality implementation.
            This time I made the game with a team of four people.</p>
          <p>As part of the group, my focus was on the player character, including both their design and programming, as well as the ability design.</p>
